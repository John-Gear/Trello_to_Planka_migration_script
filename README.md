# Trello to Planka Migration Script

## Description
This script is designed to migrate data from Trello to Planka. It automatically transfers workspaces, boards, lists, cards, comments, attachments, labels, and card covers from Trello to Planka while preserving structure and important details.

## Features
- Transfers Trello workspaces as projects in Planka.
- Transfers boards and lists from Trello to Planka.
- Transfers Trello cards while preserving completion status.
- Transfers tasks from Trello cards to Planka cards.
- Transfers comments with author, date, and timestamp.
- Transfers attachments with the original creation date added to the filename.
- Converts attachment filenames to Latin characters.
- Transfers labels and card covers.
- Logs all migration actions and errors in `log.txt`.
- Counts all transferred elements for verification.

## Script Behavior & Customization
- Comments include a signature:
  `"Imported comment from Trello, originally posted by [Author] [Username] [Date]"`
- Attachments have timestamps added to their filenames (`created_at_16-12-2024_13-18`).
- You can change the timezone in `planka_api.py` (default: `Europe/Moscow`).
- The default request delay is `0.25 sec` (can be reduced to `0.1 sec` for large migrations).

## Potential Issues & Errors
- **Error 413: `Request Entity Too Large` in Planka**
  Solution: Increase `client_max_body_size` in your `nginx` configuration.
- **Board backgrounds from Trello are not migrated**
  Planka assigns backgrounds to projects, not individual boards.
- **Images in comments may not display**
  Attachments are migrated, but Planka does not support embedded images in comments.
- **Attachments that are links will not migrate**
  Trello allows links as attachments, but Planka does not support this.
- **Duplicated Trello cards may lose comments**
  Trello does not duplicate comments when copying a card, causing API issues.

## Not realised
- **Migration of participants**  
- **Migration of archival elements (cards, boards)**

## Migration Summary
After a successful migration, `log.txt` will contain a summary:
```sh
Migration completed!
Total workspaces: 2 found in Trello, 2 migrated to Planka
Total boards: 11 found in Trello, 11 migrated to Planka
...
```
If the numbers do not match, check `log.txt` for errors using the keyword "Error".
